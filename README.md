#### Project Overview:
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model for predicting the next word in a given sequence of words using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. LSTMs are particularly effective for sequence prediction tasks because they capture long-term dependencies in data. The model is trained on the text of Shakespeare's "Hamlet," providing a rich and complex dataset that challenges the model's predictive capabilities.

The project utilizes advanced deep-learning techniques to enhance natural language processing capabilities, specifically in next-word prediction tasks. By leveraging LSTM networks, it captures intricate patterns and dependencies within text data, ultimately providing a tool for applications such as text auto-completion and interactive chatbots. The deployment through a web application allows for user-friendly interaction with the model, showcasing its practical utility in real-time scenarios.



## Workflow Description
The project follows a structured workflow consisting of six key steps:

1- `Data Collection`: We use the text of Shakespeare's "Hamlet" as our dataset. This rich, complex text provides a good challenge for our model.

2- `Data Preprocessing`: The text data is tokenized, converted into sequences, and padded to ensure uniform input lengths. The sequences are then split into training and testing sets.

3- `Model Building`: An LSTM model is constructed with an embedding layer, two LSTM layers, and a dense output layer with a softmax activation function to predict the probability of the next word.

4- `Model Training`: The model is trained using the prepared sequences, with early stopping implemented to prevent overfitting. Early stopping monitors the validation loss and stops training when the loss stops improving.

5- `Model Evaluation`: The model is evaluated using a set of example sentences to test its ability to predict the next word accurately.

6- `Deployment`: A Streamlit web application is developed to allow users to input a sequence of words and get the predicted next word in real-time.
